# YTRSS

YouTube offers an rss feed for its channels but doesn't give the media links in it. This project will generate a new rss feed and add media links to it.

# How it works?

It using the Piped api to get last 25-30 video from the youtube channel and get the video/audio link from invidious and create the rss feed.
